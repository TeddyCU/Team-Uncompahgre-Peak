## Objective

A Data Analysis of Covid19 Air Pollution Implications Through HDFS and Spark

## Project Introduction

For our project, we are going to look at recent and historical air quality data to study the impact of COVID19 related policies and restrictions on global air quality. In our analysis we will use tools such as Spark, python and AWS classroom to examine data sets related to air quality and the effects of COVID 19 on worldwide air quality data. 

## Functional and Non-functional Requirements

Establish a working team github repository for code collaboration
Create a shared location where team members can easily collaborate:
Shared Folder:
Folder should include:
Schedule and Contact information Sheet
Overview document or intro with requirement phase
Datasets for use
Shared ipython files or code files
Upload data sets via HDFS 
Process data using PySpark for functions such as aggregation
Build visualizations using the results of PySpark analysis in tools such as matplotlib and R.
Individually work on preliminary analysis to understand the data and general trends present in the data. 
Apply time series analysis tools and statistical tools like t-tests using tools like facebook prophet and R.
Use analysis tools from statistics and advanced methods such as cluster analysis to identify trends in air quality data.
Develop a compelling data presentation that is either static (powerpoint/report) or dynamic (published tableau story, R Shiny website) that conveys key findings
Create team structures that allow for individual work and collaboration:
Design list of responsibilities and set associated deadlines.
Dedicate time to collaborate with group members and discuss project progression.


## Final Data Set Site
https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/verify/1f056543-9baa-4ba0-8561-110d171415b5

We have downloaded the most up to date air quality data as of 4/12/2020 including all available data from 2019 as a comparison.
The data for each major cities is based on the average (median) of several stations. The data set provides min/max/median and standard deviation for each of the air pollutant species (PM2.5,PM10, Ozone ...) as well as meteorological data (Wind, Temperature, ...). All air pollutant species are converted to the US EPA standard (i.e. no raw concentrations). All dates are UTC based.

## Timeline

Design, Development and Test phase is due April 25th, 2020.
Deployment is due April 28th, 2020.
Presentation is due April 28th, 2020.
